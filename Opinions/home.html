        <h2 class="page-header">Why I think IDE's are bad</h2>

        <p>14 Dec 2014</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        First, let me clairify what I mean when I say "bad". Working for some large companies
        you see lots of developers who live inside their IDE's. They have never set up a development
        environment from scratch, have no idea how their code is built or executed and do not have a
        good grasp of how some of the libraries they use every day actually work. These are very
        talented developers that are very good at their jobs. However, there are times that this
        lack of knowledge can be damaging.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you look at most tutorials for compiled languages (I'm really looking at you Java),
        the first step in getting to your "Hello World" is to download and configure your IDE.
        This is wrong to me. To really learn a language I think you should have some idea of how
        your code is built and run.
        </p>

        <p>
        Do you really think that all of the bolier plate complexity would be tolerated if you,
        the developer, were required to type in every character? Do you think that the API's and 
        crazy typed error exceptions would be so commonplace?
